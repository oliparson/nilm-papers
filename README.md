# nilm-papers

This repository contains the data and jupyter notebook used to for the analysis in my [Overview of the NILM field](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/2015/03/overview-of-nilm-field.html) blog post. This repository contains two files:
- `no dots.csv` - this is a cleaned version of a CSV I exported using [Publish or Perish](http://www.harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish). The criteria I used to select NILM papers are all of those that cite Hart's 1992 paper.
- `analyse_csv.ipynb` - a jupyter notebook containing the python code I used to generate the graphs which appear in the blog post.
